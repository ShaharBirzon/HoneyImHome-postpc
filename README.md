this is relevant for ex5, ex6:
I pledge the highest level of ethical principles in support of academic excellence. I ensure that all of my work reflects my own abilities and not those of someone else.

Ex6 question: What should we add in our code-base so that when the SMS will get delivered, this notification's text will be changed to "sms sent"?
